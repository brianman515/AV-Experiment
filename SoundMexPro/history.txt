  used at all
Version 1.5.3.13, Date: 19.02.2013

  to soundcard. Thus the latency of the new volume to be audible does not depend on 
  number of buffers (see command 'init'). NOTE: this does NOT apply for 'trackvolume'.
  trackvolume has to be applied within buffers because plugins may do costy calculations
  AFTER the trackvolume and thus trackvolume has to be applied in buffered audio data!
